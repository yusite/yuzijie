## Rationale and objectives

Tax incentives for R&D is a market-based tool aimed at reducing the marginal cost of R&D activities, they allow firms to decide which R&D projects to fund.

They are expected to lead to an increase in private investment in R&D and in turn to a rise in innovation outcomes and ultimately to higher long-run growth. They can also boost R&D start-up decisions.

### Potential downsides

1. higher wage levels for researchers because more R&D increases demand for their skills (hence part of the government foregone revenue dilutes in rising cost instead of a volume increase)
2. (Re)location of R&D activities (tax competition between countries or between regions).

## Major aspects

Existing R&D tax incentive schemes differ significantly in terms of their **generosity**, their **design** and the **categories** of firms or R&D areas they target.

* expenditure based tax incentives
	* R&D tax credits
	* R&D tax allowances
	* payroll withholding tax credit for R&D wages
