## Rationale and objectives

Tax incentives for R&D is a market-based tool aimed at reducing the marginal cost of R&D activities, they allow firms to decide which R&D projects to fund.

They are expected to lead to an increase in private investment in R&D and in turn to a rise in innovation outcomes and ultimately to higher long-run growth. They can also boost R&D start-up decisions.

### Potential downsides

1. higher wage levels for researchers because more R&D increases demand for their skills (hence part of the government foregone revenue dilutes in rising cost instead of a volume increase)
2. (Re)location of R&D activities (tax competition between countries or between regions).

## Major aspects

Existing R&D tax incentive schemes differ significantly in terms of their **generosity**, their **design** and the **categories** of firms or R&D areas they target.

* Expenditure based tax incentives
	* R&D tax credits
	* R&D tax allowances
	* payroll withholding tax credit for R&D wages
* Income based tax incentives
	* preferential rates on royalty income
	* other income from knowledge capital

Most OECD and emerging economies provide R&D tax credits on the volume of R&D expenditure undertaken. Some provide R&D tax credits for R&D expenditure in excess of some baseline amount.

## Recent policy trends

The general trend has been to increase the availability, simplicity of use and generosity of R&D tax incentives. France and Australia replaced relatively complex hybrid volume- and increment-based schemes with simpler and more generous volume-based schemes. Belgium, Ireland, Korea, Norway, Portugal, and the United Kingdom have increased their tax credit rates or the ceilings for eligible R&D in recent years. China extended its R&D tax credit to all firms working in key areas of technology (biotechnology, information and communication technologies, and other high-technology fields) event if the firms are located outside the specially designated "new technology zones".

In contrast, Mexico and New Zealand have recently repealed their R&D tax incentives. Mexico converted its R&D tax credit to direct assistance in 2009. New Zealand introduced an R&D tax credit in 2008 but then repealed it, with effect from the 2009-10 fiscal year. Canada has also decided to streamline its R&D tax credit and to move its policy mix towards more direct support.

Recently, R&D tax incentives have also been used to help firms cope with the financial crisis, usually on a temporary basis. Japan and the Netherlands, for example, temporarily increased the ceiling for eligible R&D. Recognizing that several firms would not be in position to claim all of their R&D tax credit because of a likely fall in profits following the economic downturn, Japan also allowed a longer carry-forward of unused R&D credits. In 2009, France offered to refund all pending claims from previous years. Before 2009, firms had to wait for up to three years for the refund of their unused credit. This measure is expected to have increased foregone tax revenue to USD 5.5 billion in 2009 (0.26% of GDP).
