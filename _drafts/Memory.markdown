## Three memory systems [?]

### Sensory

* lasts one second [?]
* Words or numbers sent to brain by sight (visual image) start to disintegrate within a few tenths of a second & gone in one full second unless quickly transferred to S-T memory by verbal repetition. [?]

### Short-term memory (STM)

* lasts 30 seconds [?]
* Experiments show: a syllable of 3 letters remembered 50% of the time after 3 seconds. Totally forgotten end of 30 seconds.
* S-T memory - limited capacity - holds average of 7 items. [?]
* More than 7 items - jettisons some to make room.
* To hold items in STM, must rehearse - must hear sound of words internally or externally. [?]

#### Long Term memory (LTM)

* lasts a lifetime or short time [?]
* Transfer fact or idea by: [?]
    * Associating with information already in LTM.
    * Organizing information into meaningful units.
    * Understanding by comparing & making relationships.
    * Frameworking - fit pieces in like a jigsaw puzzle.
    * Reorganizing - combining new & old into a new unit.
    * Rehearsing - aloud to keep memory trace strong.

# 总结

Three kinds of memory systems are sensory, which retains information for about 1 second, short-term, which retains for a maximum of 30 seconds, and long term which varies from lifetime retention to a relatively short time.

The six activities o transfer information to the long-term memory are associating, organizing, understanding, frameworking, reorganizing, rehearsing
