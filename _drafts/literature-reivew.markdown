## purpose of literature review

> situate your study in the field
> establish a space for the work you are going to do

* discusses **a field of knowledge**
* find **concepts and approaches** that you can build on
* key **debates and differences**
* **position yourself** in relation to them

> There is one major maxim about noting - it's not rewriting the book or the article. That's a waste of time and it misses the point.

## Point of noting

* what writer is **claiming and arguing**, explain them
* putting text away, **summarize and synthesis** what you've read in your words
* not only for your immediate understanding, but use your understanding to make your own arguments

## Steps

1. **write the argument and the claim of the paper** in no more that three to four sentences.
2. **Write a small number of phrases** to answer any of these questions below
    > - Is the text located in the same field, or another one? (interdisciplinary research)
    > - What aspect of your topic does the text address?
    > - What definition is offered of the topic? (there are differing understanding of what appears to be the same thing)
    > - If the text is in the same or a different field, what concepts and language are brought to bear on the topic that might be helpful to you?
    > - What kind of text is this? Is it theory building? A think piece? A meta-study or systematic review? An empirical piece of work? How does this kind of research connect with your study?
    > - What categorizations are offered? What are the key concepts and framings that are used? Are any of these useful in your work?
    > - What connections does this text make? Are there new literatures in the reference list that you need to look at? Does the text offer new insights for your research?
    > - ...

> Crucially, once you have these kinds of systematic notes you can then group the articles in different ways.

## Questions

* try to get a sense of the field
* Where to start?
* What to eliminate?
* How to decide what is important?

## Preparation

* Do not intensively read those texts your supervisor/committee has said are must read
* Instead, spend as little as half an hour searching for a much larger number of texts.
* you can find these texts via key word search of a major journal site.

## Scan reading

1. read the title
2. read the abstract
3. read the introduction, the headings, the first and last sentences of every paragraph and the conclusion
4. tell their neighbor what they thought the article was about

> Participant are often surprised that they has grasped quite a lot from this less detailed/arduous textual engagement
> This is because articles that are well written will have the kinds of abstracts and headings that allow the reader to get to grips with the arguments quite quickly.
> a well written paragraph will have a topic sentence either at its beginning or end
> **I also ask doctoral researchers not to have a highlighter or pen in their hands but to simply read.** noting can come after a first reading.
